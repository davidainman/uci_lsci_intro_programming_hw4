# Write a function called score_unigrams that takes three arguments:
#   - a path to a folder of training data 
#   - a path to a test file that has a sentence on each line
#   - a path to an output CSV file
#
# Your function should do the following:
#   - train a single unigram model on the combined contents of every .txt file
#     in the training folder
#   - for each sentence (line) in the test file, calculate the log unigram 
#     probability using the trained model (see the lab handout for details on log 
#     probabilities)
#   - write a single CSV file to the output path. The CSV file should have two
#     columns with headers, called "sentence" and "unigram_prob" respectively.
#     "sentence" should contain the original sentence and "unigram_prob" should
#     contain its unigram probabilities.
#
# Additional details:
#   - there is training data in the training_data folder consisting of the contents 
#     of three novels by Jane Austen: Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Pride and Prejudice
#   - there is test data you can use in the test_data folder
#   - be sure that your code works properly for words that are not in the 
#     training data. One of the test sentences contains the words 'color' (American spelling)
#     and 'television', neither of which are in the Austen novels. You should record a log
#     probability of -inf (corresponding to probability 0) for this sentence.
#   - your code should be insensitive to case, both in the training and testing data
#   - both the training and testing files have already been tokenized. This means that
#     punctuation marks have been split off of words. All you need to do to use the
#     data is to split it on spaces, and you will have your list of unigram tokens.
#   - you should treat punctuation marks as though they are words.
#   - it's fine to reuse parts of your unigram implementation from HW3.

# You will need to use log and -inf here. 
# You can add any additional import statements you need here.
from math import log, inf
